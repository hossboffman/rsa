Parts of a program to encrpyt/decrypt hard drive files with an RSA key on a USB drive

I intend to have the keys stored on a USB stick so that one has to use the stick as a physical key to lock/unlock selected files. 
The finished program will be able to generate large key pairs, write them to USB sticks, and read those keys from the USB sticks when encrypting/decrypting.
Of course, it will be able to encrypt and decrypt files using the method detailed in the original RSA paper.
